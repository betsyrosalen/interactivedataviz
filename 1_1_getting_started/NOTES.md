# NOTES

## INSTRUCTIONS:
### Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.

### What did you have trouble solving?

#### PC Install
- I used GitHub Desktop and read that Git is installed automatically with GitHub Desktop, however it does not install Git Bash or add Git to the path so the command prompt was not recognizing Git.  I reinstalled Git from the link provided and then everything worked fine...

#### Mac Install
- Not done yet...

#### Checking that the GitHub pages site was working
- I wasn't careful in checking the difference between the github repo URL (starts with github.com) and the pages URL (starts with your_username.github.io).

### What went easier than expected?
1. Using GitHub Desktop and selecting the option "For my own prposes" during cloning automatically set up the fork behavior with the proper origin and upstream remote branches.  I had to check this using Command Prompt / Git Bash though because I wasn't sure it was right by looking at the settings in GitHub Desktop.
2. Found this awesome Tufte CSS style sheet here: [https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css].  I copied some of that into the stylesheet in this tutorial.

### What, if anything, is currently blocking you?
- So far, so good...

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
