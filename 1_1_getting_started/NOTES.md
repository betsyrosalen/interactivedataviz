# NOTES

-----------
## INSTRUCTIONS:
### Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.

#### What did you have trouble solving?

##### PC Install
I used GitHub Desktop and read taht Git is installed automatically with GitHub Desktop, however it does not install Git Bash or add Git to the path so the command prompt was not recognizing Git.  I reinstalled Git from the link provided and then everything worked fine...

##### Mac Install
Not done yet...

#### What went easier than expected?
1. Using GitHub Desktop and selecting the option "For my own prposes" during cloning automatically set up the fork behavior with the proper origin and upstream remote branches.
2. Found this awesome Tufte CSS style sheet here: [https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css].  I copied some of that into the stylesheet in this tutorial.

#### What, if anything, is currently blocking you?
So far, so good...

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
